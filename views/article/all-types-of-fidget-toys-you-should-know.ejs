      We know... this looks like a few keychains threaded through some bike chain links and bungeed together with a couple silicone o-rings...
    </p>
    <p>
      That's exactly what it is. With it you can spin between thumb and index/ring finger, two-handed flipping or flicking up and down around fingers.

      <img src="/img/knowledge/18.jpg" alt="Spinning Top" class="left-image"/>
      A spinning top is a toy designed to spin rapidly on the ground, the motion of which causes it to remain precisely balanced on its tip because of its rotational inertia.
      These toys have existed since antiquity.

      This small simple toy is weird. Kick it down and it will stand back straight away. Although it may look easy,
      you will need some practice to be able to flip perfectly.
